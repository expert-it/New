                TOPIC: Oozie or Easy: Managing Hadoop Workflows the EASY Way<br/>
               According to Gartner Inc., about 2/3 of all organizations are investing in Big Data and Hadoop but only 8% have production applications. Given the universal acceptance that Big Data is a huge competitive differentiator, it's likely that the companies that have not yet deployed Big Data applications are struggling to get their arms around this new technology. Industry experts agree that Hadoop and its ecosystem are extending the enterprise IT fabric rather replacing any major portions of it. This is particularly evident with workflow management where Hadoop jobs are growing in volume and complexity and are becoming more intertwined with many existing technologies. For IT organizations that already are overwhelmed by a proliferation of management tools, the ideal solution would be support for Hadoop's new workloads by the existing tools already in place, and more importantly, that already meet the required standards for governance, ease of use, reporting, planning and service level management. Such an approach will allow IT to leverage existing staff and mature best practices rather than having to re-invent the wheel yet again specifically for Hadoop.</p>

TOPIC:Practical Big Data : use cases, patterns, tools and technologies
<br/><br/>
                As businesses are realizing the power of big data analytics, they are capturing more and more data and using the data for decisions, actions and insights. In the process, the demands are increasing and the existing patterns are not meeting their needs. For ex: organizations are not satisfied with traditional analytics and they are moving towards real time and predictive analytics.Techniques and more technologies are evolving to handle massive data based on its format - structured, semi-structured, unstructured and velocity - batch, micro batch, real time.

Next, at a Berkeley start-up, he developed scalable systems for VoIP (voice over IP) telephony bootstrap and management before VoIP became mainstream. In 2003, he joined a small group at Amazon developing Amazon web services, and defined and developed the first version of NoSQL web service called Simple DB.  In 2005, he joined Yahoo! inc. where he dived into understanding and solving the problems of "big data".  He built Data Highway, a real-time log ELT and analytical warehouse on logs obtained from a global spread of 16,000 web servers every minute, and tested it with a real time data application doing Search Engine Marketing (spend) optimization.  He then went on to create a scalable near-real-time data system for display advertising auction following an acquisition by Yahoo! of the Right Media Exchange. Just before joining Microsoft last year, he built a data-driven curriculum personalization system for students at the University of Phoenix called ALE (Adaptive Learning Engine).</p>
